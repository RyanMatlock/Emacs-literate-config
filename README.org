** TODO Split config across ~core-config.org~, ~core-langs.org~, and ~extras.org~
** TODO Switch to ~straight.el~
[[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] is an Emacs package management system that apparently makes Emacs
configurations more portable across devices.

* Notes
** ~package.el~ auto-installation
Method stolen from [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/55058934][Setting up emacs on new machine with init.el and package
installation | stackoverflow]]. Note that this only sort of works; ~straight.el~
seems to work much better for me, which is why I made the transition away from
~package.el~, but I thought I'd keep a note on how I used to achieve thisâ€¦kind
of.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq my-packages
    '(auto-complete
      auto-complete-chunk
      better-defaults
      electric-case
      electric-operator
      ;; and so on
      ))

  ;; iterate over my-packages and install missing ones
  (dolist (pkg my-packages)
    (unless (package-installed-p pkg)
      (package-install pkg)))
