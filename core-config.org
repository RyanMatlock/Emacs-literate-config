* Warnings, issues, and other problems + features to consider
Going to try to keep this relatively up-to-date with current issues with my
configuration. Hopefully I'll empty this section and have everything working
the way I want it at some point---and keep it that way!

*** OPTIONAL get =smartparens= to behave like =paredit=
Still having trouble with =turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode= for Lisp modes, and
I haven't figured out where to stuff =sp-use-paredit-bindings= (although maybe
that's because it's called interactively? that doesn't seem like it would be a
problem though).

Note: when I manually enable =turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode= and
=sp-use-paredit-bindings=, I've noticed that I've had issues with ~C-u 0 C-k~
not working the way I expect it to. I've found that ~C-k~ is bound to
=sp-kill-hybrid-sexp=, so I need to look into that, although I remember coming
across some comments about some smartparens kill function that annoyed several
people enough to switch back to paredit.

*** TODO study this amazing literate config file
[[https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/][Panadestein's literate Emacs config]]

*** TODO fix minibuffer character wrap width

*** TODO Save last $n$ ~*Messages*~ buffers
It's helpful to automatically have a log of sorts, kind of like
~.bash_history~. Having this first ensures that it's done when setting up this
configuration on a new machine.

*** TODO packages to look into [0/1]
- [ ] [[https://github.com/emacs-circe/circe][circe | GitHub]]: an IRC client for Emacs (you know you only want this
  because of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe][Madeline Miller book]])

** Features to add [2/4]
- [X] complete the switch from ~package.el~ to ~straight.el~
  - [X] automatically install missing packages on startup (finding out the hard
        way that migrating this config to a new machine is a PITA)
- [X] get meta key working properly on M1 Mac Mini
- [ ] oBnOxIoUs CaSe (aka alternating case) region command (this may already
  exist, but I'm going to 1) respect other Emacs users enough to assume that it
  doesn't, and 2) try to write it myself because it seems straightforward but
  also good Emacs Lisp practice).
- [ ] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] for fancy keybindings

* Switches for additional configuration
See [[* Load additional org configuration files][code for handling processing of additional config files]] below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq emacs-config-directory (expand-file-name "~/config/emacs/"))
  (setq emacs-config-additional-files-alist
        '(("core-langs.org" . t)
          ("extras.org" . t)
          ("experimental.org" . nil)))
#+end_src

* Customize
It seems like the less I use ~customize~ outside of the literate configuration
files, the better because I can always use =(use-package ... :custom ...)= or
=setq= and annotate everything using Org mode. See [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/102/advantages-of-setting-variables-with-setq-instead-of-custom-el][Advantages of setting
variables with setq instead of custom.el? | emacs.stackexchange]] for a good
(albeit old) discussion of the relative merits of each. +I think this ought to
be loaded after everything else so customization override anything hard coded
into these config files.+ Moving this file led to weirdness/ugliness, so I'll
have to dig through the configuration. Bleh.

+There are probably a number of settings you can/should move into this,
although I'm curious how much of a pressing need there is given that with a
literate =.emacs= config, I can explain my reasoning for a setting.+

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" emacs-config-directory))
  (load custom-file)
#+end_src

While ~custom.el~ isn't literate, which is kind of a bummer, it does seem like it
can elegantly ensure that certain setting are confined to one location. Maybe
it's a good idea to move as many settings as possible out over time, and then
leave things like =custom-set-faces=. As it stands, ~custom.el~ is only 149 lines
long, which isn't too bad, and it looks like it could be shrunk further.

#+begin_example
  (custom-set-faces
   ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   '(org-level-1 ((t (:inherit default :foreground "#cb4b16" :weight bold))))
   '(org-level-2 ((t (:inherit default :foreground "#859900" :weight semi-bold))))
   '(org-level-3 ((t (:inherit default :foreground "#268bd2" :weight semi-bold)))))
#+end_example

unacceptable degree, we say "so long" to the slow modes and options enabled in
that buffer, and invoke something much more basic in their place.

****  COMMENT struggle with keybindings and prefix maps
~C-x f~ is bound to =set-fill-column=, which I don't really use. Consider making it
into a prefix key and using that instead of ~C-x x~ as the prefix for all of your
personal frame resizing functions.

*** ~s-N~ opens ~*scratch*~ buffer
I think I may start using frames to hold related sets of buffers to make
context switching easier (i.e. I can switch between frames instead of
constantly loading related sets of buffers into my usual two window setup).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq make-new-frame-default-buffer "*scratch*")

    (interactive "P")
    (let ((target-buffer
           (if alt-buffer make-new-frame-alternate-buffer

There's a slight bug with this in that if =buffer-menu= hasn't been called yet,
switching to ~*Buffer List*~ will be empty.

This is a good place to remind myself that =delete-frame= is bound to ~C-x 5 0~.

*** TODO read ~.bashrc~ & use bash as default ANSI term
Bear in mind that on your MacBook Pro, ~bash~ (the Homebrew version you use) is
located at ~/usr/local/bin/bash~, but your M1 Mac Mini, it's located at
~/opt/homebrew/bin/bash~, so maybe that's an issue? Probably helpful to know
which sort of device you're on.

Alternately, you may simply want to check for the existence of one or the other

[[https://stackoverflow.com/a/37523213][How to define a default shell for emacs | stackoverflow]]

Looking through [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/what-s-the-best-spell-check-set-up-in-emacs/][What's the best spell check setup in emacs]], I came across the
function =executable-find=, so that might be better than =file-exists-p=; on
the other hand, maybe explicitly calling out the path is what I want. On the
third hand (or back to the first hand), basically any machine I'm on is going
to have ~bash~, so maybe it's better to go with whatever the =PATH= variable
thinks I ought to use.

#+begin_example
  ELISP> (executable-find "bash")
  "/usr/local/bin/bash"
  ELISP> (executable-find "fake-foobar")
  nil
#+end_example

It works how you'd want it to for the latter case.

[Note: the ellipses are because you don't need to see /everything/.]

Let's see what happens if I set my shell to =bash= first.

It worked! Well, at least my =PATH= is right, but my =SHELL= is still
~/bin/zsh~. ~haskell-language-server-wrapper~ is working as it should too (after
some fiddling with ~ghcup~ because that Haskell tooling is not the most
user-friendly).

*** ~whitespace~
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhiteSpace][whitespace]] package: highlight lines >80 characters wide, [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhiteSpace#h5o-9][highlight ~TAB~
characters]] (~untabify~ on saving should take care of this, but IIRC makefiles
require tabs, and maybe I'll run into some situations where I want to be able
to see them).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    :hook
    ((prog-mode . whitespace-mode)
     ;; (org-mode . whitespace-mode)

          ;; display <tab> as »
          '((tab-mark ?\t [?\xBB ?\t] [?\\ ?\t])))
    (setq whitespace-line-column
          ;; 80 characters
          (+ fill-column 1))
    (setq whitespace-style '(face

=whitespace-mode= is a little weird in Org mode; as an example, shortened links
can make text appear that it's over 80 characters per line when it isn't
visually exceeding that limit.

*** Disable mouse clicks
See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4906534/disable-mouse-clicks-in-emacs][Disable mouse clicks in Emacs | stackoverflow]]

Old way:

#+begin_example
  (dolist (k '([mouse-1] [down-mouse-1] [drag-mouse-1] [double-mouse-1]
                 [triple-mouse-1] [mouse-2] [down-mouse-2] [drag-mouse-2]
                 [double-mouse-2] [triple-mouse-2] [mouse-3] [down-mouse-3]
                 [drag-mouse-3] [double-mouse-3] [triple-mouse-3] [mouse-4]
                 [down-mouse-4] [drag-mouse-4] [double-mouse-4]
                 [triple-mouse-4] [mouse-5] [down-mouse-5] [drag-mouse-5]
                 [double-mouse-5] [triple-mouse-5]))
      (global-unset-key k))
#+end_example

Idea:

#+begin_example
  ELISP> (mapcar #'make-symbol (mapcar #'(lambda (action) (format "[%s-1]" action)) '("mouse" "down-mouse")))
  (\[mouse-1\] \[down-mouse-1\])
#+end_example

#+begin_example
  ELISP> (equal [mouse-1] (make-symbol "[mouse-1]"))
  nil
#+end_example

Bummer.

See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mouse-Buttons.html][Mouse Buttons | GNU Emacs Manual]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Vectors.html][Vectors | GNU Emacs Lisp Reference]].

Wait, we're good:

#+begin_example
  ELISP> (type-of (make-symbol "[mouse-1]"))
  symbol
  ELISP> (type-of [mouse-1])
  vector
  ELISP> (vector (make-symbol "mouse-1"))
  [mouse-1]
  ELISP> (eq [mouse-1] (vector (make-symbol "mouse-1")))
  nil
  ELISP> (equal [mouse-1] (vector (make-symbol "mouse-1")))
  nil
#+end_example

Or not. :\ Let's try it anyway.

New way:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let* ((mouse-buttons (number-sequence 1 5))
         (mouse-actions '("mouse"
                          "down-mouse"
                          "drag-mouse"
                          "double-mouse"
                          "triple-mouse"))
         (mouse-clicks
          (apply #'append
                 (mapcar
                  #'(lambda (n)
                      (mapcar
                       #'(lambda (action)
                           (vector (make-symbol (format "%s-%d" action n))))
                       mouse-actions))
                  mouse-buttons))))
    (seq-do #'(lambda (key) (define-key global-map key nil)) mouse-clicks))
#+end_src

It seems to work!

** TODO Completions: ~vertico~ + ~corfu~
I used to use a combination of ~ido~ and ~ivy~, but having seen a ~vertico~ demo, I
thought I'd give it a try. ~ido~ is supposedly a bit outdated now anyway.

*** TODO ~vertico~
Following config taken from
https://systemcrafters.cc/emacs-tips/streamline-completions-with-vertico/ and
lightly edited.

So far I'm loving ~vertico~ + ~savehist~ for ~M-x~ commands! However, it seems like
=ido-everywhere= is still set to =t= by default for some reason. Oh, I have an
idea: I bet it's in =custom.el=! I'm starting to think the smarter/better way to
do most customizations is with =:custom= inside of =(straight-)use-package=
statements. Yep, that was it! Going forward, I'll try to move what I can out of
~custom.el~.

~vertico-directory~ provides for "Ido-like directory navigation," which sounds
nice to have again; configuration taken from [[https://github.com/minad/vertico#extensions][vertico | Extensions]].

This feels a little familiar, but I don't think I'm getting the behavior that I

I saw that I had [[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx]] and ~flx-ido~ in the commented-out =custom-set-variables=
block of ~legacy-dotemacs.el~, so maybe that's how I got the file completion I
miss so much.

See [[http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_ido_setup.html][Ido Mode Setup | Xah Lee]] for vertical display and [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode][Introduction to Ido

#+end_src

Ok, this actually gives me the recent file matching I remember, and +C-x C-f C-x
C-f+ ~C-x C-f C-f~ (although ~C-x C-f C-x C-f~ works too) brings up ~vertico~
matching, so maybe there's some nice way of merging the two. Actually, with the
vertical display, maybe I don't even need to do that.

Now that I'm playing around with it a little, I see that I can use
~vertico~-style commands to navigate through the options, i.e. ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ don't
let me scroll through the options once I've narrowed them.

New decision: ~C-c 2~ is globally bound to =ido-mode=, which is off by default. The
main issue is that while ~ido~ is nice for opening buffers, I find it more
annoying than ~vertico~ for switching between buffers, which is something I do
more frequently.

** TODO Project handling: ~projectile~
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]: per [[https://youtu.be/bFS0V_4YfhY][Lukewh's short projectile introduction | YouTube]], it's useful
simply for navigating between and within projects, as defined by the presence
of a ~.git~ folder or something similar.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile

    (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "C-x p") 'projectile-commander))
#+end_src

Issue (tangential): tried using recommended ~s-p~ keybinding, and it appears that
~⌘~ + ~p~ is read as ~M-p~. I think ~⌘~ should be the super key, ~s-~, but maybe I'm
wrong?

Issue 2: =projectile-command-map= doesn't seem to be the right function to
invoke. ~M-x projectile-commander~ seems to work, so try binding that? Yep, that
seems to do the trick. Now I just need to remember what the commands do.

#+end_src

tl;dr:
- While working on Exercism's Emacs Lisp track and using IELM to experiment, I
  was using ~M-x ielm-return~ to evaluate expressions, which was a little
  tedious but not /terrible/ given how I have my =execute-extended-command=
  (i.e. ~M-x~) history set up
- Paredit mode had =paredit-RET= bound to ~M-<return>~, and according to [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/16614083][Why
  can't I change paredit keybindings | stackoverflow]], paredit mode doesn't play
  nicely with the user trying to rebind keys ([[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] is supposedly better
  in that regard)
- I want =<return>= to insert a newline, =M-<return>= to evaluate an
  s-expression, and =C-c M-<return>= to evaluate an sexp for side
  effects/without printing the result
- =ielm-map= is an alias to =inferior-emacs-lisp-mode-map= (per
  https://github.com/eXLabT/emacs-lisp/blob/master/ielm.elc)
- =with-eval-after-load= works, =eval-after-load= doesn't, and I don't really
  understand why at the moment.
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/15869858][Bind command to C-RET in Emacs | stackoverflow]] has great advice for how to
  format =kbd='s argument: ~C-h k~ the key combination you want to use and see
  what Emacs calls it combination, e.g. ~C-h k C-RET~ gives ~C-<return>~, so
  you can use =(kbd "C-<return>")= when you want to bind a command to ~C-RET~.

#+begin_quote
Good to know: ~C-c M-o~ is bound to =comint-clear-buffer=, and ~C-c C-l~ is
bound to =comint-dynamic-list-input-ring=, which is basically the history of
the input.

This might be an issue.

Per [[https://github.com/NicolasPetton/emacs/blob/b176d169347925d57ca63ab63b85d92e49a53c81/lisp/ielm.el#L64][https://github.com/NicolasPetton/emacs/blob/master/lisp/ielm.el#L64]], you
could use =comint-mode-hook= and =comint-mode-map= instead of the IELM
equivalents.

I like that this doesn't have such a pesky way of handling keybindings, +but I
need to ensure that single quotes aren't added in pairs in Lisp modes,+ and I
need to enable it by default in those modes. That said, paredit seems more
assertive in preventing unbalanced parentheses, so I might need to do more
tweaking. It looks like I need to update the keybindings so slurp and barf
behave like paredit mode.

It looks like part of the smartparens documentation covers [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/wiki/Paredit-and-smartparens][paredit and
smartparens]].

Here's what I want
- [ ] enable =sp-use-paredit-bindings= in Lisp modes and possibly globally (at
  least for now; perhaps at some point I'll want to update that) ---
  =smartparens-strict-mode= actually seems to handle slurping and barfing th
  way I'm used to

#+end_src

I'm not sure that this is actually easier/less fatiguing to read. Helvetica is
actually pretty nice, but I'm not getting the desired behavior of having fixed
width font actually displaying a fixed width face.

Larger headlines:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let* ((org-headline-levels (reverse (take 4 org-level-faces)))
         (scaling 1.05)
         (height 1.1))
    (seq-do
     #'(lambda (org-level)
         (setq height (* height scaling))
         (set-face-attribute org-level nil :family "Helvetica" :height height))
     org-headline-levels))

  (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :weight 'extra-bold)
  (set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil :weight 'bold)
  (set-face-attribute 'org-level-3 nil :weight 'semi-bold)

** Keybindings
*** Still relevant?
By default

| key   | binding            | desired behavior    |
|-------+--------------------+---------------------|
| ~TAB~   | =org-cycle=          | =completion-at-point= |
| ~C-c ;~ | =org-toggle-comment= | +=iedit-...=+ nothing |

| variable              | value |
|-----------------------+-------|
| =org-cycle-emulate-tab= | =t=     |

But I want to bind ~TAB~ to =org-cycle= for headlines and =completion-at-point= for
everything else.

I'm constantly accidentally typing ~C-c ;~ when I mean to type ~C-c '~, so I want
=org-toggle-comment= to feel more intentional. I never use
=org-table-create-or-convert-from-region=, and even if I needed to use it from
time to time, I can always call it with ~M-x ...~ rather than keep it bound to a
key.

*** =iedit-mode= only available in ~src~ blocks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-iedit-only-in-src-block ()
    "Ensure iedit-mode only works in Org src block.

  Note: manually calling 「M-x iedit-mode⸥ will still work anywhere"
    (interactive)
    (cond ((org-in-src-block-p t) (iedit-mode))
          (t (progn (ding)
                    (message "You're not in an Org src block.")))))

  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c ;") 'org-iedit-only-in-src-block))
#+end_src

Note about =org-in-src-block-p=:

#+begin_quote
(org-in-src-block-p &optional INSIDE ELEMENT)

Whether point is in a code source block.
When INSIDE is non-nil, don’t consider we are within a source
block when point is at #+BEGIN_SRC or #+END_SRC.
When ELEMENT is provided, it is considered to be element at point.
#+end_quote

=(org-in-src-block-p t)= is in fact the behavior I want and not a newbie
mistake lingering on in here.

The reason I had an issue with =(void-variable org-iedit-in-src-block)= for so
long was that I forgot (read: didn't know that I needed to) quote the function
in =define-key= or =local-set-key=, but now everything works as it should.
